Data Science Process
Find a question - prediction we'd want to make =>
Explore the data - find the data we have, what we don't have, and what
we need
Prepare the data - data munging - gather, clean, and get them suitable
for analalsys
Create a model - create a model given our data, numberical, visual,
statistical, or ML model
Evaluate the model - does it help us make the decision and is it
appropriate in context
Deploy the model = communicate that in a report or deploying it
